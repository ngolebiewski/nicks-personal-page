        <h2>About Nick</h2>
          <p>I'm originally from Buffalo, NY, but have lived in New York City for over 20 years. 
          I'm a visual artist with a Bachelor's of Fine Arts degree in Painting from the University of Buffalo.
          My career path has gone through working at museums, including the Guggenheim, being a full-time-dad, being a professional artist with work shared by the 
          Whitney, Jewish Museum, Museum at Eldridge Street, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago and others.
          
          <p>I'm taking those pictorial and people skills over to the world of coding.</p>

          <p>I'm drawn to making paintings that can connect people to a place, and share storues about that location. 
          My watercolor paintings of street vendors' food carts in NYC have led to making great relationships with the vendors, often immigrants, raising funds for the non-profit Street Vendor Project, and has led to me becoming a licensed NYC Sightseeing Guide and leading food cart tours in Midtown Manhattan and in the Financial District with Turnstile Tours</p>

          <p>My biggest passion is in art education and leading drawing and watercolor workshops, helping paricipants to view the world in a slightly different way than they did before. 
            This is what I say at the start of every class:</p>
          
          <p class="quote">"There is one rule for making art, and that is that art has no rules."</p>
