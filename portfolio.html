          <h2>Escape from Buffalo</h2>
          <p class="tech">Technology: Python</p>
          <p>A text-based adventure game in the spirit of Zork or Adventure coded in Python as prompt in "Learn Python the Hard Way". 
            Concept in collaboration with my 8-year-old daughter.
            Afterall, this is a semi-autobiographical Zombie Apocalypse game.

          <h2>Prints for Ukraine</h2>
          <p class="tech">Technology: Old-fashioned watercolor paint, Etsy</p>
          <p>At the start of the Ukraine-Russia war in 2022, I wondered what I could do to help as an artist. My idea, do what I do well, make a painting.
            I made a watercolor painting of the Ukrainian restaurant Veselka*, in the East Village. 
            The owner purchased the original and we both promoted a sale of prints of the painting on our Instagram pages.
            All proceeds were donated to fund hospitals in the Ukraine, all $1,000 of it.
