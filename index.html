          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p class="quote"> "I said to myself, 'I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me—shapes and ideas near to me—so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.'' I decided to start anew to strip away what I had been taught."</p>
