# Nick Golebiewski's Personal Page Project

## Career Simulation

A project from "Calliope" to make a bio-type page to show that the quite unique person that will be working on their library page.

Three html pages are included:
- index.html -- __Landing Page__
- about.html -- __Paint a picture of who you really are page__
- portfolio.html -- ***Super important*** -- __List some projects, make it impress an employer and my teachers!__

Plus...
- readme.md -- __Practice formating readmes -- and write one.__ 
Source: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings
- styles.css -- __Make it pretty__

Things I learned...
- That a "*" background-color will give that color to every single thing. Best to remove before styling background-colors for elements. For a few minutes I couldn;t figure out why I had to add background-color into every element within the header -- and why the background of the header wasn't cascading down! Now it's pretty obvious.

Things I am struggling with...
- a:links etc. are rendering in the same style as my nav section (that is white text!) in the body of my html seemingly no matter what styles I put on in Chrome only, but looks normal in Firefox. Frustrating!
